Minku's portfolio

It's created based on HTML CSS and Javascript.
The most chellenge part to craete this site was 'scroll' in javascript.
In this project, I learned 'Intersection Observer' API to accompllish the scroll part.
The objsect accept two parameters. 
The First one accepts the callback function which has entiries and observer 
so, I could know when the elementry(entry) was in and out of the window screen(viewpoint).
The second parameter accepts options(JSON type) that I could control some details of operations by giving like root, rootMargin or threshold.
Through this function, I was able to make it possible to move through the scroll to the appropriate section by clicking.
